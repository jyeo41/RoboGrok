# RoboGrok
Collection of the labs, some quizzes and final project done throughout the online youtube course "Robogrok" by Angela Sodemann.
The website for the course can be found here: https://www.robogrok.com/

The purpose was to get a deeper understanding of how to use sensors and actuators, as well as Python by using robotics as the means
to apply the theory and practices.

The course is split into 2 parts: Robotics 1 (finished) and Robotics 2 (WIP), using a kit purchased from the professor herself.

Extensive and detailed comments have been documented throughout the project files.
